This section describes the power and minimum cabling requirements for a FlexPod Express design.

== Power requirements

The power requirements are based on U.S. specifications and assume the use of AC power. Other countries might have different power requirements. Direct current (DC) power options are also available for most components. For additional data about the maximum power required as well as other detailed power information, consult the detailed technical specifications for each hardware component.

For detailed Cisco UCS power data, see the http://www.cisco.com/assets/cdc_content_elements/flash/dataCenter/cisco_ucs_power_calculator/[Cisco UCS Power Calculator^].

The following table lists the power ports required per device.
