== Cisco Nexus switches

Redundant switches are required for all FlexPod Express architectures.

The FlexPod Express with NetApp AFF or FAS architecture is built with the Cisco Nexus 31108 switch. FlexPod Express with the Cisco UCS Mini (Cisco UCS- managed) architecture is validated by using the Cisco Nexus 3524 switch. This configuration can also be deployed with a standard switch.

The FlexPod Express with E-Series can be deployed with a standard switch.

The following table lists the part numbers for the Cisco Nexus series chassis; they do not include additional SFP or add-on modules.
