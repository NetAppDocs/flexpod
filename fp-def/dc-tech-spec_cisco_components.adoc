Cisco has contributed substantially to the FlexPod design and architecture, covering both the compute and networking layers of the solution. This section describes the Cisco UCS and Cisco Nexus options that are available for FlexPod. FlexPod supports both Cisco UCS B-Series and C-Series servers.

== Cisco UCS fabric interconnect options

Redundant fabric interconnects are required in the FlexPod architecture. When you add multiple Cisco UCS chassis to a pair of fabric interconnects, remember that the maximum number of chassis in an environment is determined by both an architectural and a port limit.

The part numbers that are shown in the following table are for the base fabric interconnects. They do not include the power supply unit (PSU) or SFP+, QSFP+, or expansion modules. Additional fabric interconnects are supported; see the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp IMT^] for a complete list.

=== Cisco UCS 6454

The Cisco UCS 6454 Series offers line-rate, low-latency, lossless 10/25/40/100GbE Ethernet and FCoE connectivity, as well as unified ports that are capable of either Ethernet or FC operation. The 44 10/25Gbps ports can operate as 10Gbps or 25Gbps converged Ethernet, of which eight are unified ports capable of operating at 8/16/32Gbps for FC. Four ports operate at 1/10/25Gbps for legacy connectivity, and six QSFP ports serve as 40/100Gbps uplink ports or breakout ports. You can establish 100Gbps end-to-end network connectivity with NetApp storage controllers that support 100Gbps adapters. For adapters and platform support, see the https://hwu.netapp.com/Adapter/Index[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

For details about ports, see the https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/servers-unified-computing/datasheet-c78-741116.html[Cisco UCS 6454 Fabric Interconnect^] Datasheet.

For technical specifications about the 100Gb QSFP data modules, see the https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/interfaces-modules/transceiver-modules/datasheet-c78-736282.html[Cisco 100GBASE QSFP Modules Datasheet^].

== Cisco software licensing options

Licenses are required to enable storage protocols on the Cisco Nexus switches. The Cisco Nexus 5000 and 7000 Series of switches all require a storage services license to enable the FC or FCoE protocol for SAN boot implementations. The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches currently do not support FC or FCoE.

The required licenses and the part numbers for those licenses vary depending on the options that you select for each component of the FlexPod solution. For example, software license part numbers vary depending on the number of ports and which Cisco Nexus 5000 or 7000 Series Switches you choose. Consult your sales representative for the exact part numbers. The table below lists the Cisco software licensing options.
