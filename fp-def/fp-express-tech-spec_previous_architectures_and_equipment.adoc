FlexPod is a flexible solution allowing customers to use both existing and new equipment currently for sale by Cisco and NetApp. Occasionally, certain models of equipment from both Cisco and NetApp are designated end of life.

Even though these models of equipment are no longer available, customers who bought one of these models before the end-of-sale date can use that equipment in a FlexPod configuration.

Additionally, FlexPod Express architectures are periodically refreshed to introduce the latest hardware and software from Cisco and NetApp to the FlexPod Express solution. This section lists the previous FlexPod Express architectures and hardware used within them.

== Previous FlexPod Express architectures

This section describes the previous FlexPod Express architectures.

=== FlexPod Express small and medium configurations

The FlexPod Express small and medium configurations include the following components:

* Two Cisco Nexus 3048 switches in a redundant configuration
* At least two Cisco UCS C-Series rack mount servers
* Two FAS2200 or FAS2500 series controllers in an HA pair configuration

The following figure illustrates the FlexPod Express small configuration.

=== FlexPod Express large configuration

The FlexPod Express large configuration includes the following components:

* Two Cisco Nexus 3500 series or Cisco Nexus 9300 series switches in a redundant configuration
* At least two Cisco UCS C-Series rack mount servers
* Two FAS2552, FAS2554, or FAS8020 controllers in an HA pair configuration (requires two 10GbE ports per controller)
* One NetApp disk shelf with any supported disk type (when the FAS8020 is used)

The following figure illustrates the FlexPod Express large configuration.
