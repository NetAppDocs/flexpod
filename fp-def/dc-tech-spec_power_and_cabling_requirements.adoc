A FlexPod design has minimum requirements for power and cabling.

== Power requirements

Power requirements for FlexPod Datacenter differ based on the location where the FlexPod Datacenter configuration is installed.

For more data about the maximum power that is required and for other detailed power information, consult the technical specifications for each hardware component listed in the section link:dc-tech-spec_technical_specifications_and_references.html[Technical Specifications and References: Hardware Components].

For detailed Cisco UCS power data, see the http://www.cisco.com/assets/cdc_content_elements/flash/dataCenter/cisco_ucs_power_calculator/[Cisco UCS power calculator^].

For NetApp storage controller power data, see the http://hwu.netapp.com/Controller/Index?platformTypeId=6780858[NetApp Hardware Universe^]. Under Platforms, select the storage platform that you want to use in the configuration (FAS/V-Series or AFF). Select the ONTAP version and storage controller, and then click the Show Results button.

== Minimum cable requirements

The number and type of cables and adapters that are required vary per FlexPod Datacenter deployment. The cable type, transceiver type, and number are determined during the design process based on your requirements. The table below lists the minimum number of cables required.
