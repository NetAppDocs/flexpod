NetApp storage controllers provide the storage foundation in the FlexPod Express architecture for both boot and application data storage. This section lists the different NetApp options in the FlexPod Express architecture.

== NetApp storage controller options

== NetApp FAS

Redundant AFF C190, AFF A220, or FAS2750 series controllers are required in the FlexPod Express architecture. The controllers run ONTAP software. When ordering the storage controllers, the preferred software version can be preloaded on the controllers. For ONTAP, the cluster can be deployed either with a pair of cluster interconnect switches or in a switchless cluster configuration.

The part numbers listed in the following table are for an empty controller. Different options and configurations are available based on the storage platform selected. Consult your sales representative for details about these additional components.

[NOTE]
====
The FAS2500 and 2600 series storage systems have onboard 10GbE ports.

The NetApp X1117A adapter is for FAS8020 storage systems.

|X-56024-00-0E-C
|===

[NOTE]
====
The E2824 series storage systems have onboard 10GbE ports.

The 10GbE iSCSI/16Gb FC 4-port host interface card (HIC) can be used for additional port density.
====

The onboard ports and the HIC can function as iSCSI adapters or FC adapters depending on the feature activated in SANtricity OS.

For more information about supported adapter options, see the Adapter section of https://hwu.netapp.com/Adapter/Index[NetApp Hardware Universe^].

== NetApp disk shelves and disks

== NetApp FAS

A minimum of one NetApp disk shelf is required for storage controllers. The NetApp shelf type selected determines which drive types are available within that shelf.

The FAS2700 and FAS2600 series of controllers are offered as a configuration that includes dual storage controllers plus disks housed within the same chassis. This configuration is offered with SATA or SAS drives; therefore, additional external disk shelves are not needed unless performance or capacity requirements dictate more spindles.

[NOTE]
====
All disk shelf part numbers are for the empty shelf with two AC PSUs. Consult your sales representative for additional part numbers.

Disk drive part numbers vary according to the size and form factor of the disk you intend to purchase. Consult your sales representative for additional part numbers.
====

The following table lists the NetApp disk shelf options, along with the drives supported for each shelf type, which can be found on NetApp Hardware Universe. Follow the Hardware Universe link, select the version of ONTAP you are using, then select the shelf type. Under the shelf image, click Supported Drives to see the drives supported for specific versions of ONTAP and the disk shelves.

=== E-Series storage

A minimum of one NetApp disk shelf is required for storage controllers that do not house any drives in their chassis. The NetApp shelf type selected determines which drive types are available within that shelf.

The E2800 series of controllers are offered as a configuration that includes dual storage controllers plus disks housed within a supported disk shelf. This configuration is offered with SSD or SAS drives.

[NOTE]
Disk drive part numbers vary according to the size and form factor of the disk you intend to purchase. Consult your sales representative for additional part numbers.

The following table lists the NetApp disk shelf options and the drives supported for each shelf type, which can be found on NetApp Hardware Universe. Follow the Hardware Universe link, select the version of ONTAP you are using, then select the shelf type. Under the shelf image, click Supported Drives to see the drives supported for specific versions of ONTAP and the disk shelves.
