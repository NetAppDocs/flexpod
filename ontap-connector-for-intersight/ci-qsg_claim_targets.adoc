After Cisco Intersight Assist is installed, you can claim your NetApp storage and virtualization devices. Return to the *Intersight Targets* page and add your vCenter and NetApp Active IQ Unified Manager targets. For more information about the claim process, watch the video https://tv.netapp.com/detail/video/6228080442001[Claim a Target via Cisco Intersight Assist. ^]
