== Cisco Intersight licensing requirements

Cisco Intersight is licensed on a subscription basis with multiple license editions from which to choose. Capabilities increase with the different license types. You can purchase a subscription duration of one, three, or five years and choose the required Cisco UCS Server volume tier for the selected subscription duration. Each Cisco endpoint automatically includes a Cisco Intersight Base at no additional cost when you access the Cisco Intersight portal and claim a device.

You can purchase any of the following higher-tier Intersight licenses using the Cisco ordering tool:

* *Cisco Intersight Essentials.* Essentials includes all functionality of the Base tier with the additional features including Cisco UCS Central and Cisco IMC Supervisor entitlement, policy-based configuration with Service Profiles, firmware management, and evaluation of compatibility with the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).
* *Cisco Intersight Advantage.* Advantage offers all features and functionality of the Base and Essentials tiers. It includes storage widgets, storage inventory, storage capacity, and storage utilization, and cross-domain inventory correlation across physical compute, physical storage, and virtual environments (VMware ESXi).
* *Cisco Intersight Premier.* In addition to the capabilities provided in the Advantage tier, Cisco Intersight Premier offers Private Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) orchestration across Cisco UCS, and third-party systems, including virtual machines (VMs) (VMware vCenter) and physical storage (NetApp storage).
