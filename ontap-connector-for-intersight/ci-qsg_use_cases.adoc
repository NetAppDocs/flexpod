These are a few use case examples for monitoring and orchestration of NetApp storage from Cisco Intersight.

== Use case 1: Monitoring NetApp storage inventory and widgets

When the NetApp storage environment is available in Cisco Intersight, you can monitor NetApp storage objects in detail from storage inventory and get an overview from storage widgets.

. Deploy Intersight Assist OVA (OnPrem task in vCenter Environment).
. Add NetApp AIQ UM devices in Intersight Assist.
. Go to *Storage* and navigate through NetApp storage inventory.
. Add *Widgets* for NetApp storage to your *Monitor Dashboard*.

== Use case 2: NetApp storage orchestration using Reference Workflows

When NetApp storage and vCenter environments are available in Cisco Intersight, you can execute end-to-end Reference Workflows available out of box that include storage and virtualization tasks.

. Deploy Intersight Assist OVA (OnPrem task in vCenter Environment).
. Add NetApp AIQ UM devices in Intersight Assist.
. Add the vCenter target to Intersight via Intersight Assist.
. Execute Reference Workflows available out of box.
+
Here is a list of Reference Workflows:

** New NAS Datastore
** New Storage Export Policy
** New Storage Host
** New Storage Interface
** New Storage Virtual Machine
** New Virtual Machine
** New VMFS Datastore
** Remove NAS Datastore
** Remove Storage Export Policy
** Remove Storage Host
** Remove VMFS Datastore
** Update NAS Datastore
** Update Storage Host
** Update VMFS Datastore

== Use case 3: Custom workflows using designer-free form

When the NetApp Storage and vCenter environments are available in Cisco Intersight, you can build custom workflows using the NetApp storage and virtualization tasks.

. Deploy Intersight Assist OVA (OnPrem task in vCenter Environment)
. Add NetApp AIQ UM devices in Intersight Assist.
. Add vCenter target to Intersight via Intersight Assist.
. Navigate to the *Orchestration* tab in Intersight.
. Select *Create Workflow*.
. Add storage and virtualization tasks to your workflows.
+
Here are the NetApp storage tasks that are available from Cisco Intersight:

** Add Storage Export Policy to Volume
** Connect Initiators to Storage Host
** Disconnect Storage Export Policy From Volume
** Edit Aggregates for Storage Virtual Machine
** Edit Storage Export Policy Rule
** Edit Storage Snapshot Policy
** Edit Storage Snapshot Policy Schedule
** Expand Storage LUN
** Expand Storage Volume
** Find NetApp igroup LUN Map
** Find Storage LUN by ID
** Find Storage Volume by ID
** New Storage Export Policy
** New Storage Export Policy Rule
** New NetApp Storage Fibre Channel Interface
** New Storage Host
** New Storage IP interface
** New Storage LUN
** New Storage LUN ID
** New NetApp Storage NAS Smart Volume
** New NetApp Storage Smart LUN
** New Storage Snapshot Policy
** New Storage Snapshot Policy Schedule
** New Storage Virtual Machine
** New Storage volume
** New Storage Volume Snapshot
** Remove Storage export policy
** Remove Storage Export Policy Rule
** Remove Storage FC Interface
** Remove Storage host
** Remove Storage IP Interface
** Remove Storage LUN
** Remove Storage LUN ID
** Remove NetApp Storage Smart LUN
** Remove Storage Snapshot Policy
** Remove Storage Snapshot Policy Schedule
** Remove Storage Virtual Machine
** Remove storage volume
** Remove Storage Volume Snapshot
** Rename Storage Volume Snapshot
+
NOTE: The New Storage NAS Smart Volume and New Storage Smart LUN tasks will only work with ONTAP 9.8 and above. ONTAP 9.7P1 is currently the minimum supported version.
