These are a few use case examples for monitoring and orchestration of NetApp storage from Cisco Intersight.

== Use case 1 Monitoring NetApp storage inventory and widgets

When the NetApp storage environment is available in Cisco Intersight, you can monitor NetApp storage objects in detail from storage inventory and get an overview from storage widgets.

. Deploy Intersight Assist OVA (OnPrem task in vCenter Environment).
. Add NetApp AIQ UM devices in Intersight Assist.
. Go to *Storage* and navigate through NetApp storage inventory.
. Add *Widgets* for NetApp storage to your *Monitor Dashboard*.

== Use case 2 NetApp storage orchestration using Reference Workflows

When NetApp storage and vCenter environments are available in Cisco Intersight, you can execute end-to-end Reference Workflows available out of box that include storage and virtualization tasks.

. Deploy Intersight Assist OVA (OnPrem task in vCenter Environment).
. Add NetApp AIQ UM devices in Intersight Assist.
. Add the vCenter target to Intersight via Intersight Assist.
. Execute Reference Workflows available out of box.
+
Here is a list of Reference Workflows:

** New Storage Interface
** New VMFS Datastore
** Update VMFS Datastore
** Remove VMFS Datastore
** New NAS Datastore
** Update NAS Datastore
** Remove NAS Datastore
** New Storage Host
** Update Storage Host
** Remove Storage Host
** New Storage Export Policy
** Remove Storage Export Policy
** New Storage Virtual Machine
** New Virtual Machine

== Use case 3 Custom workflows using designer-free form

When the NetApp Storage and vCenter environments are available in Cisco Intersight, you can build custom workflows using the NetApp storage and virtualization tasks.

. Deploy Intersight Assist OVA (OnPrem task in vCenter Environment)
. Add NetApp AIQ UM devices in Intersight Assist.
. Add vCenter target to Intersight via Intersight Assist.
. Navigate to the *Orchestration* tab in Intersight.
. Select *Create Workflow*.
. Add storage and virtualization tasks to your workflows.
+
Here are the NetApp storage tasks that are available from Cisco Intersight:

** Task 1: Add Storage Export Policy to Volume
** Task 2: Connect Initiators to Storage Host (igroup)
** Task 3: Expand Storage LUN
** Task 4: Expand Storage Volume
** Task 5: Find NetApp igroup LUN Map
** Task 6: Find Storage LUN by ID
** Task 7: Find Storage Volume by ID
** Task 8: New Storage Export Policy
** Task 9: New Storage Fibre Channel Interface
** Task 10: New Storage Host
** Task 11: New storage IP interface
** Task 12: New storage LUN
** Task 13: New storage LUN ID
** Task 14: New Storage Virtual Machine
** Task 15: New storage volume
** Task 16: Remove storage export policy
** Task 17: Remove storage host
** Task 18: Remove storage LUN
** Task 19: Remove storage LUN ID
** Task 20: Remove storage volume
