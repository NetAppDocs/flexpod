Cisco Validated Designs (CVDs) consist of systems and solutions that are designed, tested, and documented to facilitate and improve customer deployments. These designs incorporate a wide range of technologies and products into a portfolio of solutions that have been developed to address the business needs of our customers and to guide them from design to deployment.

Cisco and NetApp have partnered to deliver a series of FlexPod solutions that enable strategic data center platforms. FlexPod solution delivers an integrated architecture that incorporates compute, storage, and network design best practices thereby minimizing IT risks by validating the integrated architecture to ensure compatibility between various components. The solution also addresses IT pain points by providing documented design guidance, deployment guidance and support that can be used in various stages (planning, designing and implementation) of a deployment.

This document describes Cisco ACI integrated FlexPod solution as a validated approach for deploying SAP HANA Tailored Data Center Integration (TDI) environments. This validated design provides guidelines and a framework for implementing SAP HANA with best practices from Cisco and NetApp.

The recommended solution architecture is built on the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) using a unified software release to support Cisco UCS hardware platforms that include the following components:

* Cisco UCS B-Series blade servers and Cisco UCS C-Series rack servers configurable with Intel Optane Data Center Persistent Memory Module (DCPMM) option

* Cisco UCS 6400 series Fabric Interconnects

* Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Leaf and Spine switches

* NetApp All Flash series storage arrays

Additionally, this guide provides validations for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP HANA.
