The FlexPod platform is a predesigned, best practice data center architecture that is built on the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS), the Cisco Nexus family of switches, and NetApp storage controllers (AFF, ASA, or FAS systems).

FlexPod is a suitable platform for running SAP applications, and the solutions provided here allows you to quickly and reliably deploy SAP HANA with a model of tailored datacenter integration. FlexPod delivers not only a baseline configuration, but also the flexibility to be sized and optimized to accommodate many different use cases and requirements.
