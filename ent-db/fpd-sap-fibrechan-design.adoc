Cisco and NetApp have partnered to deliver a series of FlexPod solutions that enable strategic data center platforms. FlexPod solution delivers an integrated architecture that incorporates compute, storage, and network design best practices thereby minimizing IT risks by validating the integrated architecture to ensure compatibility between various components. The solution also addresses IT pain points by providing documented design guidance, deployment guidance and support that can be used in various stages (planning, designing and implementation) of a deployment.

While the previous validations with FlexPod have been primarily NFS centric, this exercise addresses the Fibre Channel (FC) based solution as a validated approach for deploying SAP HANAÂ® Tailored Data Center Integration (TDI) environments. This design guide provides guidelines and a framework for implementing SAP HANA with best practices from Cisco and NetApp.

The recommended solution architecture is built on the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) using a unified software release to support Cisco UCS hardware platforms and NetApp All Flash storage. It includes the following components:

* Cisco UCS B-Series blade servers and Cisco UCS C-Series rack servers configurable with Intel Optane Data Center Persistent Memory Module (DCPMM) option

* Cisco UCS 6400 series Fabric Interconnects

* Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches and  Cisco Multilayer Director Switches(MDS) switches 

* NetApp All Flash series storage arrays

* Additionally, this guide provides validations for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP HANA.
