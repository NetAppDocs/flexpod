Cisco Validated Designs include systems and solutions that are designed, tested, and documented to facilitate and improve customer deployments. These designs incorporate a wide range of technologies and products into a portfolio of solutions that have been developed to address the business needs of customers. Cisco and NetApp have partnered to deliver FlexPod, which serves as the foundation for a variety of workloads and enables efficient architectural designs that are based on customer requirements. A FlexPod solution is a validated approach for deploying Cisco and NetApp technologies as a shared cloud infrastructure.

The FlexPod Datacenter with NetApp All Flash AFF system is a converged infrastructure platform that combines best-of breed technologies from Cisco and NetApp into a powerful converged platform for enterprise applications. Cisco and NetApp works closely with Oracle to support the most demanding transactional and response-time-sensitive databases required by todayâ€™s businesses.

This Cisco Validated Design (CVD) describes the reference FlexPod Datacenter architecture using Cisco UCS and NetApp All Flash AFF Storage for deploying a highly available Oracle RAC Database environment. This document shows the hardware and software configuration of the components involved, results of various tests and offers implementation and best practices guidance using Cisco UCS Compute Servers, Cisco Fabric Interconnect Switches, Cisco MDS Switches, Cisco Nexus Switches, NetApp AFF Storage and Oracle RAC Database.
