This FlexPod Express solution is part of the FlexPod converged infrastructure program.

== FlexPod Converged Infrastructure Program

FlexPod reference architectures are delivered as Cisco Validated Designs (CVDs) or NetApp Verified Architectures (NVAs). Deviations based on customer requirements from a given CVD or NVA are permitted if these variations do not create an unsupported configuration.

As depicted in the following figure, the FlexPod program includes three solutions: FlexPod Express, FlexPod Datacenter, and FlexPod Select:

* *FlexPod Express.* Offers customers an entry-level solution with technologies from Cisco and NetApp.
* *FlexPod Datacenter.* Delivers an optimal multipurpose foundation for various workloads and applications.
* *FlexPod Select.* Incorporates the best aspects of FlexPod Datacenter and tailors the infrastructure to a given application.

The following figure shows the technical components of the solution.

== NetApp Verified Architecture program

The NVA program offers customers a verified architecture for NetApp solutions. An NVA provides a NetApp solution architecture with the following qualities:

* Is thoroughly tested
* Is prescriptive in nature
* Minimizes deployment risks
* Accelerates time to market

This guide details the design of FlexPod Express with direct-attached NetApp storage. The following sections list the components used in this solution design.

=== Hardware components

* NetApp AFF A220 or FAS 2750/2720
* Cisco UCS Mini
* Cisco UCS B200 M5
* Cisco UCS VIC 1440/1480
* Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches

=== Software components

* NetApp ONTAP 9.5
* VMware vSphere 6.7U1
* Cisco UCS Manager 4.0 (1b)
* Cisco NXOS firmware 7.0(3)I6(1)
