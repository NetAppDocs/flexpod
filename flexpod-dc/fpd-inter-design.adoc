This document describes a validated solution for deploying Cisco and NetApp technologies as a shared cloud infrastructure. This validated design provides a framework for deploying VMware vSphere, the most popular virtualization platform in enterprise-class data centers, on FlexPod.

FlexPod is a leading integrated infrastructure supporting a broad range of enterprise workloads and use cases. This solution enables customers to quickly and reliably deploy a VMware vSphere-based private cloud on an integrated infrastructure.
