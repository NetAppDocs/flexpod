This document provides details for configuring a fully redundant, highly available FlexPod Express system. To reflect this redundancy, the components being configured in each step are referred to as either component A or component B. For example, controller A and controller B identify the two NetApp storage controllers that are provisioned in this document. Switch A and switch B identify a pair of Cisco Nexus switches.

In addition, this document describes steps for provisioning multiple Cisco UCS hosts, which are identified sequentially as server A, server B, and so on.

To indicate that you should include information pertinent to your environment in a step, `\<<text>>` appears as part of the command structure. See the following example for the `vlan create` command:

....
Controller01>vlan create vif0 <<mgmt_vlan_id>>
....

This document enables you to fully configure the FlexPod Express environment. In this process, various steps require you to insert customer-specific naming conventions, IP addresses, and virtual local area network (VLAN) schemes. The table below describes the VLANs required for deployment, as outlined in this guide. This table can be completed based on the specific site variables and used to implement the document configuration steps.

[NOTE]
If you use separate in-band and out-of-band management VLANs, you must create a layer- 3 route between them. For this validation, a common management VLAN was used.

|AN Name |VLAN Purpose |ID Used in Validating This Document

|Management VLAN
|VLAN for management interfaces
|3437
|Native VLAN
|VLAN to which untagged frames are assigned
|2
|NFS VLAN
|VLAN for NFS traffic
|3438
|VMware vMotion VLAN
|VLAN designated for the movement of virtual machines from one physical host to another
|3441
|Virtual machine traffic VLAN
|VLAN for virtual machine application traffic

The VLAN numbers are needed throughout the configuration of FlexPod Express. The VLANs are referred to as `\<<var_xxxx_vlan>>`, where `xxxx` is the purpose of the VLAN (such as iSCSI-A).
