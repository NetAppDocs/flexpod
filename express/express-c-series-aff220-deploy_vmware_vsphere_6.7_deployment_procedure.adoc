This section provides detailed procedures for installing VMware ESXi 6.7 in a FlexPod Express configuration. The deployment procedures that follow are customized to include the environment variables described in previous sections.

Multiple methods exist for installing VMware ESXi in such an environment. This procedure uses the virtual KVM console and virtual media features of the CIMC interface for Cisco UCS C-Series servers to map remote installation media to each individual server.

[NOTE]
This procedure must be completed for Cisco UCS server A and Cisco UCS server B.

This procedure must be completed for any additional nodes added to the cluster.

== Log in to CIMC interface for Cisco UCS C-Series standalone servers

The following steps detail the method for logging in to the CIMC interface for Cisco UCS C-Series standalone servers. You must log in to the CIMC interface to run the virtual KVM, which enables the administrator to begin installation of the operating system through remote media.

=== All hosts

. Navigate to a web browser and enter the IP address for the CIMC interface for the Cisco UCS C-Series. This step launches the CIMC GUI application.
. Log in to the CIMC UI using the admin user name and credentials.
. In the main menu, select the Server tab.
. Click Launch KVM Console.
+

. From the virtual KVM console, select the Virtual Media tab.
. Select Map CD/DVD.
+
[NOTE]
You might first need to click Activate Virtual Devices. Select Accept This Session if prompted.

. Browse to the VMware ESXi 6.7 installer ISO image file and click Open. Click Map Device.
. Select the Power menu and choose Power Cycle System (Cold Boot). Click Yes.

== Install VMware ESXi

The following steps describe how to install VMware ESXi on each host.

=== Download ESXI 6.7 Cisco custom image

. Navigate to the https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/6_7[VMware vSphere download page^] for custom ISOs.
. Click Go to Downloads next to the Cisco Custom Image for ESXi 6.7 GA Install CD.
. Download the Cisco Custom Image for ESXi 6.7 GA Install CD (ISO).

=== All hosts

. When the system boots, the machine detects the presence of the VMware ESXi installation media.
. Select the VMware ESXi installer from the menu that appears.
+
The installer loads. This takes several minutes.

. After the installer has finished loading, press Enter to continue with the installation.
. After reading the end-user license agreement, accept it and continue with the installation by pressing F11.
. Select the NetApp LUN that was previously set up as the installation disk for ESXi, and press Enter to continue with the installation.
+
image:express-c-series-aff220-deploy_image22.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

. Select the appropriate keyboard layout and press Enter.
. Enter and confirm the root password and press Enter.
. The installer warns you that existing partitions are removed on the volume. Continue with the installation by pressing F11. The server reboots after the installation of ESXi.

== Set up VMware ESXi host management networking

The following steps describe how to add the management network for each VMware ESXi host.

=== All hosts

. After the server has finished rebooting, enter the option to customize the system by pressing F2.
. Log in with root as the login name and the root password previously entered during the installation process.
. Select the Configure Management Network option.
. Select Network Adapters and press Enter.
. Select the desired ports for vSwitch0. Press Enter.
+
[NOTE]

. Enter the IP address for managing the VMware ESXi host `\<<esxi_host_mgmt_ip>>`.
. Enter the subnet mask for the VMware ESXi host `\<<esxi_host_mgmt_netmask>>.`
. Enter the default gateway for the VMware ESXi host `\<<esxi_host_mgmt_gateway>>`.
. Press Enter to accept the changes to the IP configuration.
. Enter the IPv6 configuration menu.
. Use the space bar to disable IPv6 by unselecting the Enable IPv6 (restart required) option. Press Enter.
. Enter the menu to configure the DNS settings.
. Because the IP address is assigned manually, the DNS information must also be entered manually.
. Enter the primary DNS server’s IP address `<<nameserver_ip>>`.
. (Optional) Enter the secondary DNS server’s IP address.
. Enter the FQDN for the VMware ESXi host name: `<<esxi_host_fqdn>>`.
. Press Enter to accept the changes to the DNS configuration.
. Exit the Configure Management Network submenu by pressing Esc.
. Press Y to confirm the changes and reboot the server.
