== FlexPod Converged Infrastructure Portfolio

FlexPod reference architectures are delivered as Cisco Validated Designs (CVDs) or as NetApp Verified Architectures (NVAs). Deviations that are based on customer requirements from a given CVD or NVA are permitted if those variations do not result in the deployment of unsupported configurations.

As illustrated in the following figure, the FlexPod portfolio includes the following solutions: FlexPod Express and FlexPod Datacenter.

* *FlexPod Express* is an entry-level solution with technologies from Cisco and NetApp.
* *FlexPod Datacenter* delivers an optimal multipurpose foundation for various workloads and applications.

== NetApp Verified Architecture program

The NetApp Verified Architecture program offers customers a verified architecture for NetApp solutions. An NVA solution has the following qualities:

* Is thoroughly tested
* Is prescriptive in nature
* Minimizes deployment risks
* Accelerates time to market This guide details the design of FlexPod Express with VMware vSphere.

In addition, this design leverages the all-new AFF C190 system, which runs NetApp ONTAP 9.6 software, Cisco Nexus 31108 switches, and Cisco UCS C220 M5 servers as hypervisor nodes.

== Solution overview

FlexPod Express is designed to run mixed virtualization workloads. It is targeted for remote and branch offices and for small to midsize businesses. It is also optimal for larger businesses that want to implement a dedicated solution for a specific purpose. This new solution for FlexPod Express adds new technologies such as NetApp ONTAP 9.6, NetApp AFF C190 system, and VMware vSphere 6.7U2.

The following figure shows the hardware components that are included in the FlexPod Express solution.
