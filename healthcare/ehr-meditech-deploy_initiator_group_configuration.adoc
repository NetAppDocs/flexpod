summary: When you use FC as the data network protocol, create two initiator groups (igroups) on each storage controller. The first igroup contains the WWPNs of the FC host interface cards on the VMware ESXi servers that host the MEDITECH host VMs (igroup for MEDITECH).

When you use FC as the data network protocol, create two initiator groups (igroups) on each storage controller. The first igroup contains the WWPNs of the FC host interface cards on the VMware ESXi servers that host the MEDITECH host VMs (igroup for MEDITECH).

You must set the MEDITECH igroup operating system type according to the environment setup. For example:

* Use the igroup operating system type `Windows` for applications that are installed on bare-metal-server hardware in a Windows Server environment.
* Use the igroup operating system type `VMware` for applications that are virtualized by using the VMware vSphere hypervisor.

[NOTE]
The operating system type for an igroup might be different from the operating system type for a LUN. As an example, for virtualized MEDITECH hosts, you should set the igroup operating system type to `VMware`. For the LUNs that are used by the virtualized MEDITECH hosts, you should set the operating system type to `Windows 2008 or later`. Use this setting because the MEDITECH host operating system is the Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit Enterprise Edition.

To determine the correct value for the operating system type, see the sections “LUN Igroup Create” and “LUN Create” in the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMP1366832[Clustered Data ONTAP 8.2 Commands: Manual Page Reference^].
