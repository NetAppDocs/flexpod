== Storage sizing

This section describes the number of studies and the corresponding infrastructure requirements.

The storage requirements that are listed in the following table assume that existing data is 1 year’s worth plus projected growth for 1 year of study in the primary system (tier 1, 2). Additional storage needs for projected growth for 3 years beyond the first 2 years are listed separately.
