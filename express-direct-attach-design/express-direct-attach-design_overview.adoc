Industry trends indicate a vast data center transformation toward shared infrastructure and cloud computing. In addition, organizations seek a simple and effective solution for remote and branch offices, leveraging the technology that they are familiar with in their data center.

FlexPod Express is a predesigned, best practice architecture that is built on the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS), the Cisco Nexus family of switches, and NetApp AFF. The components in FlexPod Express are like their FlexPod Datacenter counterparts, enabling management synergies across the complete IT infrastructure environment on a smaller scale. FlexPod Datacenter and FlexPod Express are optimal platforms for virtualization and for bare-metal operating systems and enterprise workloads.

FlexPod Datacenter and FlexPod Express deliver a baseline configuration and have the versatility to be sized and optimized to accommodate many different use cases and requirements. Existing FlexPod Datacenter customers can manage their FlexPod Express by using the tools that they are accustomed to, and new FlexPod Express customers can easily adapt to managing a FlexPod Datacenter as their environment grows.

FlexPod Express is an optimal infrastructure foundation for remote offices or branch offices (ROBOs) and for small to midsize businesses. It is also an optimal solution for customers who want to provide infrastructure for a dedicated workload.

FlexPod Express provides an easy-to-manage infrastructure that is suitable for almost any workload.
