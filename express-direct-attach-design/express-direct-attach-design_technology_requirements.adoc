A FlexPod Express system requires a combination of hardware and software components. FlexPod Express also describes the hardware components that are required to add hypervisor nodes to the system in units of two.

== Hardware requirements

Regardless of the hypervisor chosen, all FlexPod Express configurations use the same hardware.  Therefore, even if business requirements change, either hypervisor can run on the same FlexPod Express hardware.

The following table lists the hardware components that are required for all FlexPod Express configurations.
