FlexPod Express requires a combination of hardware and software components that depends on the selected hypervisor and network speed. In addition, FlexPod Express lays out the hardware components that are required to add hypervisor nodes to the system in units of two.

== Hardware requirements

Regardless of the hypervisor chosen, all FlexPod Express configurations use the same hardware. Therefore, even if business requirements change,  you can use a different hypervisor on the same FlexPod Express hardware.

The following table lists the hardware components that are required for this FlexPod Express configuration and to implement this solution. The hardware components that are used in any implementation of the solution can vary based on customer requirements.
