In this section, we review the architecture of a FlexPod Datacenter converged infrastructure, including a NetApp AFF A800 system that is monitored by Cloud Insights.

== Solution technology

A FlexPod Datacenter solution consists of the following minimum components to provide a highly available, easily scalable, validated, and supported converged infrastructure environment.

* Two NetApp ONTAP storage nodes (one HA pair)
* Two Cisco Nexus data center network switches
* Two Cisco MDS fabric switches (optional for FC deployments)
* Two Cisco UCS fabric interconnects
* One Cisco UCS blade chassis with two Cisco UCS B-series blade servers

Or

* Two Cisco UCS C-Series rackmount servers

For Cloud Insights to collect data, an organization must deploy an Acquisition Unit as a virtual or physical machine either within their FlexPod Datacenter environment, or in a location where it can contact the components from which it is collecting data. You can install the Acquisition Unit software on a system running several supported Windows or Linux operating systems. The following table lists solution components for this software.

== Use case details

This solution applies to the following use cases:

* Analyzing the environment with data provided to NetApp Active IQ digital advisor for assessment of storage system risks and recommendations for storage optimization.
* Troubleshooting problems in the ONTAP storage system deployed in a FlexPod Datacenter solution by examining system statistics in real-time.
* Generating customized dashboards to easily monitor specific points of interest for ONTAP storage systems deployed in a FlexPod Datacenter converged infrastructure.
