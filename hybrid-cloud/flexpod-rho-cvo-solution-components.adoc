== Astra Trident

Astra Trident is an open-source, fully supported storage orchestrator for containers and Kubernetes distributions. It was designed from the beginning to help you meet your containerized applications’ persistence demands using industry-standard interfaces, such as the https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/introduction.html[Container Storage Interface (CSI)^]. With Astra Trident, microservices and containerized applications can take advantage of enterprise-class storage services provided by the NetApp portfolio of storage systems.

Astra Trident is deployed on Kubernetes clusters as pods and provides dynamic storage orchestration services for your Kubernetes workloads. It enables your containerized applications to consume persistent storage quickly and easily from NetApp’s broad portfolio, which includes NetApp ONTAP (NetApp AFF, NetApp FAS, NetApp ONTAP Select, Cloud, and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP), NetApp Element software (NetApp SolidFire), as well as the Azure NetApp Files service, Cloud Volume Service on Google Cloud, and the Cloud Volume Service on AWS. In a FlexPod environment, Astra Trident is used to dynamically provision and manage persistent volumes for containers that are backed by NetApp FlexVol volumes and LUNs hosted on an ONTAP storage platform such as NetApp AFF and FAS systems and Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Trident also plays a key role in the implementation of application protection schemes delivered by Astra Control. For more information about Astra Trident, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/index.html[Astra Trident documentation.^]

== Storage backend

To use Astra Trident, you need supported storage backend. A Trident backend defines the relationship between Trident and a storage system. It tells Trident how to communicate with that storage system and how Trident should provision volumes from it. Trident will automatically offer up storage pools from backends that together match the requirements defined by a storage class.

* ONTAP AFF and FAS storage backend. As a storage software and hardware platform, ONTAP provides core storage services, support for multiple storage access protocols, and storage management functionality, such as NetApp Snapshot copies and mirroring.
* Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage backend

== Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a container application platform that brings together CRI-O and Kubernetes and provides an API and web interface to manage these services. CRI-O is an implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to enable using Open Container Initiative (OCI) compatible runtimes. It is a lightweight alternative to using Docker as the runtime for Kubernetes.

OpenShift Container Platform allows customers to create and manage containers. Containers are standalone processes that run within their own environment, independent of operating system and the underlying infrastructure. OpenShift Container Platform helps develop, deploy, and manage container-based applications. It provides a self-service platform to create, modify, and deploy applications on demand, thus enabling faster development and release life cycles. OpenShift Container Platform has a microservices-based architecture of smaller, decoupled units that work together. It runs on top of a Kubernetes cluster, with data about the objects stored in etcd, a reliable clustered key-value store.

The following image is an overview of the Red Hat OpenShift Container platform.

image:flexpod-rho-cvo-image7.png[Error: Missing Graphic Image]

=== Kubernetes infrastructure

Within OpenShift Container Platform, Kubernetes manages containerized applications across a set of CRI-O runtime hosts and provides mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and application-scaling. The CRI-O service packages, instantiates, and runs containerized applications.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of one or more masters and a set of worker nodes. This solution design includes high availability (HA) functionality at the hardware as well as the software stack. A Kubernetes cluster is designed to run in HA mode with three master nodes and a minimum of two worker nodes to help ensure that the cluster has no single point of failure.

=== Red Hat Core OS

OpenShift Container Platform uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), a container-oriented operating system that combines some of the best features and functions of the CoreOS and Red Hat Atomic Host operating systems. RHCOS is specifically designed for running containerized applications from OpenShift Container Platform and works with new tools to provide fast installation, operator-based management, and simplified upgrades.

RHCOS includes the following features:

* Ignition, which OpenShift Container Platform uses as a first boot system configuration for initially bringing up and configuring machines.
* CRI-O, a Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates closely with the operating system to deliver an efficient and optimized Kubernetes experience. CRI-O provides facilities for running, stopping, and restarting containers. It fully replaces the Docker Container Engine, which was used in OpenShift Container Platform 3.
* Kubelet, the primary node agent for Kubernetes, is responsible for launching and monitoring containers.

== VMware vSphere 7.0

VMware vSphere is a virtualization platform for holistically managing large collections of infrastructures (resources including CPUs, storage, and networking) as a seamless, versatile, and dynamic operating environment. Unlike traditional operating systems that manage an individual machine, VMware vSphere aggregates the infrastructure of an entire data center to create a single powerhouse with resources that can be allocated quickly and dynamically to any application in need.

For more information, see https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html[VMware vSphere^].

=== VMware vSphere vCenter

VMware vCenter Server provides unified management of all hosts and VMs from a single console and aggregates performance monitoring of clusters, hosts, and VMs. VMware vCenter Server gives administrators a deep insight into the status and configuration of compute clusters, hosts, VMs, storage, the guest OS, and other critical components of a virtual infrastructure. VMware vCenter manages the rich set of features available in a VMware vSphere environment.

== Hardware and software revisions

This solution can be extended to any FlexPod environment that is running supported versions of software, firmware, and hardware as defined in the http://support.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] and https://www.cisco.com/web/techdoc/ucs/interoperability/matrix/matrix.html[Cisco UCS Hardware Compatibility List.^] The OpenShift cluster is installed on FlexPod in a Bare Metal fashion as well as on VMware vSphere.

Only a single instance of Astra Control Center is required to manage multiple OpenShift (k8s) clusters, while Trident CSI is installed on each OpenShift cluster. Astra Control Center can be installed on any of these OpenShift cluster. In this solution,  Astra Control Center is installed on the OpenShift bare- metal cluster.
