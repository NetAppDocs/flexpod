You can install Astra Control Center either on OpenShift cluster running on FlexPod or on AWS with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage backend. In this solution, Astra Control Center is deployed on the OpenShift bare-metal cluster.

Astra Control Center can be installed using the standard process described https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/get-started/install_acc.html[here^] or from the Red Hat OpenShift OperatorHub. Astra Control Operator is a Red Hat certified operator. In this solution, Astra Control Center is installed using the Red Hat OperatorHub.

== Environment requirements

* Astra Control Center supports multiple Kubernetes distributions; for Red Hat OpenShift, the supported versions include Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 or 4.9.
* Astra Control Center requires the following resources in addition to the environment’s and the end-user's application resource requirements:

|===
|Components |Requirement

|Storage backend capacity
|At least 500GB available
|Worker nodes
|At least 3 worker nodes, with 4 CPU cores and 12GB RAM each
|Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) address
|An FQDN address for Astra Control Center
|Astra Trident
|Astra Trident 21.04 or newer installed and configured
|Ingress controller or
load balancer
|Configure the ingress controller to expose Astra Control Center with a URL or load balancer to provide IP address which will resolve to the FQDN
|===

* You must have an existing private image registry to which you can push the Astra Control Center build images. You need to provide the URL of the image registry where you upload the images.

[NOTE]
Some images are pulled while executing certain workflows, and containers are created and destroyed when necessary.

* Astra Control Center requires that a storage class be created and set as the default storage class. Astra Control Center supports the following ONTAP drivers provided by Astra Trident:

** ontap-nas
** ontap-nas-flexgroup
** ontap-san
** ontap-san-economy

[NOTE]
We assume that the deployed OpenShift clusters have Astra Trident installed and configured with an ONTAP backend, and a default storage class is also defined.

* For application cloning in OpenShift environments, Astra Control Center needs to allow OpenShift to mount volumes and change the ownership of files. To modify the ONTAP export policy to allow these operations, run the following commands:

....
export-policy rule modify -vserver <storage virtual machine name> -policyname <policy name> -ruleindex 1 -superuser sys
export-policy rule modify -vserver <storage virtual machine name> -policyname <policy name> -ruleindex 1 -anon 65534
....

[NOTE]
To add a second OpenShift operational environment as a managed compute resource, make sure that the Astra Trident Volume snapshot feature is enabled. To enable and test volume snapshots with Astra Trident, see the official https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html[Astra Trident instructions^].

* A https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/vol-snapshots.html[VolumeSnapClass^] should be configured on all Kubernetes clusters from where the applications is managed. This could also include the K8s cluster on which Astra Control Center is installed. Astra Control Center can manage applications on the K8s cluster on which it is running.

=== Application management requirements

* *Licensing.* To manage applications using Astra Control Center, you need an Astra Control Center license.
* *Namespaces.* A namespace is the largest entity that can be managed as an application by Astra Control Center. You can choose to filter out components based on the application labels and custom labels in an existing namespace and manage a subset of resources as an application.
* *StorageClass.* If you install an application with a StorageClass explicitly set and you need to clone the application, the target cluster for the clone operation must have the originally specified StorageClass. Cloning an application with an explicitly set StorageClass to a cluster that does not have the same StorageClass fails.
* *Kubernetes resources.* Applications that use Kubernetes resources not captured by Astra Control might not have full application data management capabilities. Astra Control can capture the following Kubernetes resources:

|===
|Kubernetes resources | |

|ClusterRole
|ClusterRoleBinding
|ConfigMap
|CustomResourceDefinition
|CustomResource
|CronJob
|DaemonSet
|HorizontalPodAutoscaler
|Ingress
|DeploymentConfig
|MutatingWebhook
|PersistentVolumeClaim
|Pod
|PodDisruptionBudget
|PodTemplate
|NetworkPolicy
|ReplicaSet
|Role
|RoleBinding
|Route
|Secret
|ValidatingWebhook
|
|

== Install Astra Control Center using OpenShift OperatorHub

The following procedure installs Astra Control Center using Red Hat OperatorHub. In this solution, Astra Control Center is installed on a bare-metal OpenShift cluster running on FlexPod.

. Download the Astra Control Center bundle (`astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz`) from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support site^].
. Download the .zip file for the Astra Control Center certificates and keys from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support site^].
. Verify the signature of the bundle.
+
....
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify astra-control-center[version].pub -signature <astra-control-center[version].sig astra-control-center[version].tar.gz
....

. Extract the Astra images.
+
....
tar -vxzf astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz
....

. Change to the Astra directory.
+
....
cd astra-control-center-[version]
....

. Add the images to your local registry.
+
....
For Docker:
docker login [your_registry_path]OR
For Podman:
podman login [your_registry_path]
....

. Use the appropriate script to load the images, tag the images, and push them to your local registry.
+
For Docker:
+
....
export REGISTRY=[Docker_registry_path]
for astraImageFile in $(ls images/*.tar) ; do
  # Load to local cache. And store the name of the loaded image trimming the 'Loaded images: '
  astraImage=$(docker load --input ${astraImageFile} | sed 's/Loaded image: //')
  astraImage=$(echo ${astraImage} | sed 's!localhost/!!')
  # Tag with local image repo.
  docker tag ${astraImage} ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
  # Push to the local repo.
  docker push ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
done
....
+
For Podman:
+
....
export REGISTRY=[Registry_path]
for astraImageFile in $(ls images/*.tar) ; do
  # Load to local cache. And store the name of the loaded image trimming the 'Loaded images: '
  astraImage=$(podman load --input ${astraImageFile} | sed 's/Loaded image(s): //')
  astraImage=$(echo ${astraImage} | sed 's!localhost/!!')
  # Tag with local image repo.
  podman tag ${astraImage} ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
  # Push to the local repo.
  podman push ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
done
....

. Log into the bare-metal OpenShift cluster web console. From the side menu, select Operators > OperatorHub. Enter `astra` to list the `netapp-acc-operator`.

As a part of Kubernetes cluster registration with Astra Control Center for application-aware data management, Astra Control automatically creates role bindings and a NetApp monitoring namespace to collect metrics and logs from the application pods and worker nodes. Make one of the supported ONTAP-based storage classes the default.

After you https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/get-started/setup_overview.html[add a cluster to Astra Control management^], you can install apps on the cluster (outside of Astra Control) and then go to the Apps page in Astra Control to manage the apps and their resources. For more information about managing apps with Astra, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/use/manage-apps.html[App management requirements^].
