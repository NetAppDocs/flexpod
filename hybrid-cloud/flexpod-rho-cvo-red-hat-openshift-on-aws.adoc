OpenShift is deployed as a https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-private.html[private cluster^] into an existing VPC on AWS. A private OpenShift Container Platform cluster does not expose external endpoints and is accessible from only an internal network and is not visible to the internet. A single-node NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP is deployed using NetApp Cloud Manager, which provides a storage backend to Astra Trident.

For more information about installing OpenShift on AWS, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.html[OpenShift documentation^].
