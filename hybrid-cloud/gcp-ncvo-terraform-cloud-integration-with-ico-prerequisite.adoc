== Procedure 1 Connect Cisco Intersight and Terraform Cloud

. Claim or create a Terraform cloud target by providing the relevant Terraform Cloud account details.
. Create a Terraform Cloud Agent target for private clouds so that customers can install the agent in the data center and enable communication with Terraform Cloud.
+
For more information, follow https://intersight.com/help/saas/features/terraform_cloud/admin[this link^].

== Procedure 2: Generate user token

As a part of adding a target for Terraform Cloud, you must provide the username and API token from the Terraform Cloud settings page.

. Login to Terraform Cloud and go to *User Tokens*: https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens[https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens^].
. Click *Create a new API token*.
. Assign a name to remember and save the token in a secure place.

== Procedure 3: Claim Terraform Cloud Target

. Log into Intersight with Account Administrator, Device Administrator, or Device Technician privileges.
. Navigate to *ADMIN > Targets > Claim a New Target*.
. In *Categories*, click *Cloud*.
. Click *Terraform Cloud* and click *Start*.

. Enter a name for the target, your username for the Terraform Cloud, the API token, and a default organization in Terraform Cloud as displayed in the following image.
. In the *Default Managed Hosts* field, make sure to add the following links along with other managed hosts:
+
** github.com
** github-releases.githubusercontent.com
+

If everything is correctly entered, you will see your Terraform Cloud target displayed in the *Intersight Targets* section.

== Procedure 4: Add Terraform Cloud agents

Prerequisites:

* Terraform Cloud target.
* Claimed Intersight Assist into Intersight before deploying the Terraform Cloud Agent.

[NOTE]
You can only claim five agents for each Assist.

[NOTE]
After you have created the connection to Terraform, you must spin up a Terraform Agent to execute the Terraform code.

. Click *Claim Terraform Cloud Agent* from the drop-down list of your Terraform Cloud target.
. Enter the details for the Terraform Cloud agent. The following screenshot shows the configuration details for Terraform agent.
+

[NOTE]
You can update any Terraform Agent property. If the target is in the *Not Connected* state and has never been in the *Connected* state, then a token has not been generated for the Terraform agent.

After the agent validation succeeds and an agent token is generated, you are unable to reconfigure the Organization and/or Agent Pool. Successful deployment of a Terraform agent is indicated by a status of *Connected*.

After you have enabled and claimed the Terraform Cloud integration, you can deploy one or more Terraform Cloud agents in Cisco Intersight Assist. The Terraform Cloud agent is modelled as a child target of the Terraform Cloud target. When you claim the agent target, you see a message to indicate that the target claim is in progress.

After a few seconds, the target is moved to the *Connected* state, and the Intersight platform routes HTTPS packets from the agent to the Terraform Cloud gateway.

Your Terraform Agent should be correctly claimed and should show up under targets as *Connected*.
