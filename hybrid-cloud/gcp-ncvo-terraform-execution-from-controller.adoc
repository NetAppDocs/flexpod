We can execute the Terraform plan using a controller.  You can skip this section if you have already executed your Terraform plan using an ICO workflow.

=== Prerequisites

Setup of the solution begins with a management workstation that has access to the Internet and with a working installation of Terraform.

A guide for installing Terraform can be found https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli[here^].  

==== Clone GitHub repo

The first step in the process is to clone the GitHub repo to a new empty folder on the management workstation. To clone the GitHub repository,  complete the following steps:

. From the management workstation, create a new folder for the project. Create a new folder inside this folder named `/root/snapmirror-cvo` and Clone the GitHub repo into it.
. Open a command-line or console interface on the management workstation and change directories to the new folder just created.
. Clone the GitHub collection using the following command:

....
Git clone 
....

. Change directories to the new folder named `snapmirror-cvo`.*Terraform execution*

* *Init.* Initialize the (local) Terraform environment. Usually executed only once per session.
* *Plan.* Compare the terraform state with the as-in state in the cloud and build and display an execution plan. This does not change the deployment (read-only).
* *Apply.* Apply the plan from the plan phase. This potentially changes the deployment (read and write).
* *Destroy.* All resources that are governed by this specific terraform environment.
