== NetApp Active IQ Unified Manager

NetApp Active IQ Unified Manager allows the monitoring of your ONTAP storage clusters from a single, redesigned, and intuitive interface that delivers intelligence from community wisdom and AI analytics. It provides comprehensive operational, performant, and proactive insights into the storage environment and the virtual machines running on it. When an issue occurs with the storage infrastructure, Unified Manager can notify you about the details of the issue to help identify the root cause. The virtual machine dashboard gives you a view into the performance statistics for the VM so that you can investigate the entire I/O path from the vSphere host down through the network and finally to the storage.

Some events also provide remedial actions that can be taken to rectify the issue. You can configure custom alerts for events so that when issues occur, you are notified through email and SNMP traps. Active IQ Unified Manager allows you to plan for the storage requirements of your users by forecasting capacity and usage trends so that you can act before issues arise, preventing reactive short-term decisions that can lead to additional problems in the long term.

For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/[Active IQ Unified Manager^].

== Cisco Intersight

Cisco Intersight is a SaaS platform that delivers intelligent automation, observability, and optimization for traditional and cloud-native applications and infrastructure. The platform helps to drive change with IT teams and delivers an operating model designed for hybrid cloud. Cisco Intersight provides the following benefits:

* *Faster delivery.* Intersight is delivered as a service from the cloud or in the customer’s data center with frequent updates and continued innovation, due to an agile-based software development model. In this way, the customer can focus on supporting critical business needs.
* *Simplified operations.* Intersight simplifies operations by using a single, secure SaaS-delivered tool with common inventory, authentication, and APIs to work across the full stack and all locations, eliminating silos across teams. This allows you to manage physical servers and hypervisors on-premises, to VMs, K8s, serverless, automation, optimization, and cost control both on-premises and in public clouds.
* *Continuous optimization.* You can continuously optimize your environment by using intelligence provided by Cisco Intersight across every layer, as well as by Cisco TAC. This intelligence is converted into recommended and automatable actions so that you can adapt in real-time to any changes: from moving workloads and monitoring the health of physical servers to cost reduction recommendations for the public clouds that you work with.

There are two modes of management operations possible with Cisco Intersight: UCSM Managed Mode (UMM) and Intersight Managed Mode (IMM). You can select the native UCSM Managed Mode (UMM) or Intersight Managed Mode (IMM) for fabric-attached Cisco UCS systems during the initial setup of the fabric Interconnects. In this solution, native IMM is used. The following figure shows the Cisco Intersight Dashboard.
