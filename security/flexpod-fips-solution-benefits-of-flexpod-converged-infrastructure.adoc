Healthcare organizations have several mission-critical systems. Two of the most critical systems are the electronic health record (EHR) systems and medical imaging systems. To demonstrate the FIPS setup on a FlexPod system, we used an open-source EHR and an open-source picture archiving and communication system (PACS) system for the lab setup and workload validation on the FlexPod system. For a complete list of EHR capabilities, EHR logical application components, and how EHR systems benefit when implemented on a FlexPod system see https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/22199-tr-4881.pdf[TR-4881: FlexPod for Electronic Health Record Systems^]. For a complete list of a medical imaging system capabilities, logical application components, and how medical imaging systems benefit when implemented on FlexPod, see https://www.netapp.com/media/19793-tr-4865.pdf[TR-4865: FlexPod for Medical Imaging^].

During the FIPS setup and workload validation, we exercised workload characteristics that were representative of a typical healthcare organization. For example, we exercised an open-source EHR system to include realistic patient data access and change scenarios. Additionally, we exercised medical imaging workloads that included digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) objects in a `*. dcm` file format. DICOM objects with metadata were stored on both the file and block storage. Additionally, we implemented multipathing capabilities from within a virtualized RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) server. We stored DICOM objects on an NFS, mounted LUNs using iSCSI, and mounted LUNs using FC. During the FIPS setup and validation, we observed that the FlexPod converged infrastructure exceeded our expectations and performed seamlessly.

The following figure depicts the FlexPod system used for FIPS setup and validation. We leveraged the https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/UCS_CVDs/fp_vmware_vsphere_7_0_ontap_9_7.html[FlexPod Datacenter with VMware vSphere 7.0 and NetApp ONTAP 9.7 Cisco Validated Design (CVD)^] during the setup process.

== Solution infrastructure hardware and software components

The following two figures list the hardware and software components respectively used during the FIPS testing enabling on a FlexPod. The recommendations in these tables are examples; you should work with your NetApp SME to make sure that the components are suitable for your organization. Also, make sure that the components and versions are supported in the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] (IMT) and https://ucshcltool.cloudapps.cisco.com/public/[Cisco Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)^].
