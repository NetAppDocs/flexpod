== Network connectivity

The following network connections must be in place before you configure the infrastructure:

* Link aggregation that uses port channels and virtual port channels (vPCs) is used throughout, enabling the design for higher bandwidth and high availability:
** vPC is used between the Cisco FI and Cisco Nexus switches.
** Each server has virtual network interface cards (vNICs) with redundant connectivity to the Unified Fabric. NIC failover is used between FIs for redundancy.
** Each server has virtual host bus adapters (vHBAs) with redundant connectivity to the Unified Fabric.
* The Cisco UCS FI is configured in end- host mode as recommended, providing dynamic pinning of vNICs to uplink switches.

== Storage connectivity

The following storage connections must be in place before you configure the infrastructure:

* Storage port interface groups (ifgroups, vPC).
* 10Gb link to switch N9K-A.
* 10Gb link to switch N9K-B.
* In- band management (active-passive bond):
** 1Gb link to management switch N9K-A
** 1Gb link to management switch N9K-B
* 32Gb FC end-to-end connectivity through Cisco MDS switches; single initiator zoning configured.
* FC SAN boot to fully achieve stateless computing; servers are booted from LUNs in the boot volume that is hosted on the AFF storage cluster.
* All MEDITECH workloads are hosted on FC LUNs, which are spread across the storage controller nodes.

== Host software

The following software must be installed:

* ESXi installed on the Cisco UCS blades
* VMware vCenter installed and configured (with all the hosts registered in vCenter)
* VSC installed and registered in VMware vCenter
* NetApp cluster configured
