NetApp storage that is deployed for MEDITECH software environments uses storage controllers in a high-availability-pair configuration. Storage must be presented from both controllers to MEDITECH database servers over the FC Protocol. The configuration presents storage from both controllers to evenly balance the application load during normal operation.

== ONTAP configuration

This section describes a sample deployment and provisioning procedures that use the relevant ONTAP commands. The emphasis is to show how storage is provisioned to implement the storage layout that NetApp recommends, which uses a high-availability controller pair. One of the major advantages with ONTAP is the ability to scale out without disturbing the existing high-availability pairs.

=== ONTAP licenses

After you have set up the storage controllers, apply licenses to enable the ONTAP features that NetApp recommends. The licenses for MEDITECH workloads are FC, CIFS, and NetApp Snapshot, SnapRestore, FlexClone, and SnapMirror technologies.

To configure licenses, open NetApp ONTAP System Manager, go to Configuration-Licenses, and then add the appropriate licenses.

Alternatively, run the following command to add licenses by using the CLI:

....
license add -license-code <code>
....

=== AutoSupport configuration

The NetApp AutoSupport tool sends summary support information to NetApp through HTTPS. To configure AutoSupport, run the following ONTAP commands:

....
autosupport modify -node * -state enable
autosupport modify -node * -mail-hosts <mailhost.customer.com>
autosupport modify -node prod1-01 -from prod1-01@customer.com
autosupport modify -node prod1-02 -from prod1-02@customer.com
autosupport modify -node * -to storageadmins@customer.com
autosupport modify -node * -support enable
autosupport modify -node * -transport https
autosupport modify -node * -hostnamesubj true
....

=== Hardware-assisted takeover configuration

On each node, enable hardware-assisted takeover to minimize the time that it takes to initiate a takeover in the unlikely event of a controller failure. To configure hardware-assisted takeover, complete the following steps:

. Run the following ONTAP command to xxx.
+
Set the partner address option to the IP address of the management port for `prod1-01`.
+
....
MEDITECH::> storage failover modify -node prod1-01 -hwassist-partner-ip <prod1-02-mgmt-ip>
....

. Run the following ONTAP command to xxx:
+
Set the partner address option to the IP address of the management port for `cluster1-02`.
+
....
MEDITECH::> storage failover modify -node prod1-02 -hwassist-partner-ip <prod1-01-mgmt-ip>
....

. Run the following ONTAP command to enable hardware-assisted takeover on both the `prod1-01` and the `prod1-02` HA controller pair.
+
....
MEDITECH::> storage failover modify -node prod1-01 -hwassist true
MEDITECH::> storage failover modify -node prod1-02 -hwassist true
....
